# This is my repo of goofing around

There are only two rules:

* No tests
* No production code

Everything else is fair game.

## Stuff I could be doing

* A [netpbm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format) [raytracer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray%20tracing%20%28graphics%29)
* A really dumb search engine, and perhaps a [cleverer](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/irbook.html) one later.
* Silly custom protocol (just ping <=> pong over a socket to with)
* [WebGL tutorials](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?page_id=1217), maybe some sort of solar walk eventually
